Shrine Logic

Shrines have ID values.
A static current shrine ID variable exists (this will be added to a savedata system at some point).

The scene does not have a player by default. The player is spawned in by the current shrine, if the player needs spawning at all.
The player is always added to DontDestroyOnLoad on awake, but is removed upon dying to allow a new player to load in.

When resting at a shrine, the shrine is added to DontDestroyOnLoad and the current shrine ID is set to its ID. Then, the scene is reloaded additively.
All newly loaded shrines check the current shrine ID on awake. If it is their ID, they destroy themselves. Otherwise, they load in as normal.
The current shrine detects a player already exists and does not spawn a new player.
The current shrine is then removed from DontDestroyOnLoad, leaving only the player.

When the player dies, no shrines are added to DontDestroyOnLoad but current shrine ID is unchanged. Then, the scene is reloaded (maybe additively? might not be necessary).
All shrines load in as normal, even if they are the current shrine.
The current shrine detects a player does not exist, so it spawns a new player.
